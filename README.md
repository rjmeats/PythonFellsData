# Python program to extract Lake District fells data from Wikipedia

This Python program uses the [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) library to extract height and location information from Wikipedia about Lake District fells, as
classified by [Alfred Wainwright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Wainwright) in his [Pictorial Guides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictorial_Guide_to_the_Lakeland_Fells).

The data is written to a CSV file, which can then be processed further, e.g. in [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/richard.meats#!/vizhome/LakelandFells/Map)
